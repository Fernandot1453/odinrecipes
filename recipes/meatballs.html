        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup plain breadcrumps</li>
            <li>1/2 grated Parmesan</li>
            <l1>1/2 tsp garlic powder</l1>
            <li>1/2 tsp onion powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp pepper</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1 lb. bulk italian sausage</li>
            <li>1 lb. ground beef</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. In a separate small bowl, lightly whisk the two eggs.</li>
            <li>Add the breadcrumb mixture, eggs, milk, Italian sausage, and ground beef to a large bowl. Use your hands to mix the ingredients together until evenly combined. Avoid over mixing the meat.
            </li>
            <li>Let the meatball mixture rest for five minutes to allow the breadcrumbs time to soften. Divide and shape the meat into about 32 meatballs, approximately 2 Tbsp in volume each.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Oven Cooking Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400ÂºF. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Place the meatballs on the baking sheet about one inch apart from each other.
            </li>
            <li>Bake the meatballs for about 15 minutes, or until lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Transfer the meatballs to a pot of red sauce and simmer for five more minutes in the sauce. If not using a red sauce, add an additional 3-5 minutes to the bake time, or until the meatballs are cooked through.
            </li>
        </ol>
